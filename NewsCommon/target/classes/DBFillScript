  ('GENE WILDER DEAD', 'Willy Wonka star dies aged 83 following a battle with Alzheimer’s, the legendary actor’s family announce',
   'Anyone who’s read Gene Wilder’s 1970 letter about the costume suggestions for Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory to the
   movie’s director, Mel Stuart, let alone seen his performance in the film, knows that he was no slouch when it came to creating
   wise and confident solo performances.
“I don’t think of Willy as an eccentric who holds onto his 1912 Daddy’s Sunday suit and wears it in 1970,” he wrote, “but rather as
just an eccentric – where there’s no telling what he’ll do or where he ever found his get-up – except that it strangely fits him …
Jodhpurs to me belong more to the dancing master. But once elegant now almost baggy trousers – baggy through preoccupation with
more important things – is character … The hat is terrific, but making it two inches shorter would make it more special …
To match the shoes with the jacket is fey. To match the shoes with the hat is taste.”
He describes Wonka, perfectly, as “part of this world, part of another … Something mysterious, yet undefined”.
However, it was in Wilder’s collaborations that the shrewdness and generosity of this famously kind man really shone through.
Willy Wonka aside, Wilder will forever be best known for his long relationships with three of the best-loved American comedians
to have emerged in the 1960s and 70s: Mel Brooks, Richard Pryor and Gilda Radner. Wilder’s work with Brooks produced arguably
both of their best work: The Producers, Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein. As a writer-director combination, they were as
natural and well-matched as Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. In a PBS documentary about Brooks, Wilder was asked if he thought his
initial meeting with Brooks was significant. Wilder burst out laughing: “When God spoke to Moses the first time, would you ask
him, ‘Was that significant in your life?’” he replied, still chortling. “I would say it had some minor importance, yes.”
For his part, Brooks put it like this: “Everything Gene did for me was angelic and supreme.” When news of Wilder’s death broke,
Brooks, now 90, tweeted: “Gene Wilder – One of the truly great talents of our time. He blessed every film we did with his magic &
 he blessed me with his friendship.”',

  ('donald trump nascar north carolina republicans', 'Trump''s slump in Nascar country deepens
  Republican fears of defeat', 'One month on from a precipitous collapse in Donald Trump’s poll ratings, many Republicans are no
  longer asking whether he can win the White House, but how badly he will lose. Election models put Hillary Clinton’s chances of
  victory in November’s presidential election at over 80% – in the words of the New York Times, her chance of losing is about the
  same as the probability that an NFL kicker makes a field goal from the 20-yard line. FiveThirtyEight statistician Nate Silver
  predicts a 28% chance of a landslide, in which she wins the popular vote by double digits.
Pundits have been wrong about Trump before, and in recent polls he has shown some signs of recovery. A Morning Consult poll
released on Sunday showed him three points down on Clinton head-to-head, a halving of the gap a week before. The
realclearpolitics.com average of polls, however, had him down by six. Answering the question of just how bad things could get
for Republicans, in Senate and House races as well as the general election, requires state-by-state analysis, an assessment of
congressional contests and, perhaps, a little unscientific sampling of the mood.
Among demographic stereotypes who ought to remain loyal to Trump, few stand out quite like the “Nascar dads”. In 2004, these
supposedly white, male and mostly southern fans of the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing were targeted by Democrats
in their battle with George W Bush. In 2016, after eight years of Barack Obama, they should be a bastion of enthusiasm for Trump.
While other former swing demographics, such as “soccer moms” in the suburbs, look lost to Clinton for good, white men in America’s
red states are at the heart of Trump’s support. Early on, the campaign heralded an endorsement by Nascar boss Brian France and
several drivers.
Yet recently, outside the Nascar Hall of Fame in Charlotte, the mood among visiting families who spoke to the Guardian before a
recent Trump rally in the city seemed at best to have stalled.
At first, Keith, a former military man from nearby Fayetteville, home to Fort Bragg, the world’s largest military base, was

   ('Are expensive wines worth the money?', 'Not every $100 bottle tastes better than a $20 one', 'If you had around $100 to
   spend on an evening’s entertainment for two, what would it get you? It might stretch to a night at the cinema followed by
   a simple meal in a curry house or chain restaurant. Provided you go easy on the drinks, it may just cover a night’s clubbing
   and a taxi home. And depending on the teams, it might get you two seats high up in the stands at a Premier League game,
    plus a couple of substandard pints and a gristly half-time hot dog each, if you’re lucky.
 In each of those cases, the chances of a truly memorable evening (the genuinely great film; the riveting 4-3 scoreline; the
 mind-altering DJ set and up-for-it crowd) are not, if we’re honest, all that great. More likely you’ll have forgotten all
 about the night’s events by the following week. And yet only the most unforgiving puritan would condemn you for splashing
 out on these inessential fripperies. Nobody would brand you a decadent snob or a fool.
 Split that $100 with a mate on a bottle of wine, however, and you’d better be braced for sanctimony and ridicule. Never mind
 that those rare occasions when I have done just have provided at least as much pleasure, in their way, as the greatest films
  or football matches. To even contemplate spending so much on a bottle of wine is, for many, always going to be Bullingdon
   Club obscene.
 It’s not just the price tag that gets people’s goat. It’s more that they can’t see how it translates into tangible differences
 in quality. People hear about the trophy-winning $5 Spanish red beating wines 10 times the price in taste tests. Or they skim-read
  a news story where experts can’t tell the difference between a $50 and a $5 bottle. And they sniff a bouquet of rat, with notes of
   emperor’s new clothes: the scent of a con perpetuated on credulous snobs.
 As with all conspiracy theories, this is difficult to argue against. If you’ve never tried a wine over $20, or have done but been
 left thinking “meh”, you only have the word of an oenophile like me to go on that the differences can be profound. And it’s not
 easy to explain why a bottle of wine should ever cost more than $20, let alone as much as $100 or even $1,000.',

  ('UK staycations grow in strength as pound weakens', 'Visit England looks to build on rising number of Britons taking bank
  holiday break at home as exchange rates and terror attacks deter foreign travel', 'The government is to launch a tourism action
   plan including cutting red tape for B&Bs and ready-made train tours as an increasing number of Brits take bank holiday breaks
    in the UK.
Just over 5 million Britons are planning a staycation in the UK over the weekend, 6% more than last year, according to Visit
England, the tourism promotion body, after a fall in the value of the pound against the dollar and the euro in the wake of the
 EU referendum vote.The expected surge comes after a record-breaking first four months of the year for domestic holiday trips in
 England. From January to April Britons took 11m holiday trips, 8% more than during the same period last year, according to
 Visit England. They spent $2.8bn, 22% up on last year, more than ever before.
That continued a strong year in 2015 for staycations when the number of trips and the amount spent both rose 7% on the
 previous year. The prime minister, Theresa May, who chose to holiday in the Swiss Alps this month, said: “Tourism is vitally
 important to the UK and the sector goes from strength to strength. Our stunning scenery, centuries-old monuments and cultural
 traditions continue to draw visitors from both home and abroad.” The government action plan will include internationally promoted
 rail travel deals, with five easily bookable itineraries that will help tourists get around the UK, although it’s not clear if
  they will be assured a seat. There will also be changes to regulations to let B&Bs offer visitors a welcome drink without the
  need for an alcohol licence, or to pick up guests from a station without applying to become a taxi service.',

  ('Pope Francis says destroying environment is a sin', 'Pontiff says humans are turning planet into ‘wasteland full of debris,
  desolation and filth’ in call for urgent action on climate change', 'Pope Francis has called for urgent action to stop climate
  change and proposed that caring for the environment be added to traditional Christian works of mercy such as feeding the hungry
  and visiting the sick. In a message to mark the Catholic church’s World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation that he launched
  last year, Francis said the worst impact of global warming was being felt by those who were least responsible for it – refugees
  and the poor. The pontiff used the occasion to revive many of the powerful issues he highlighted a year ago in his provocative
  encyclical on the environment, Laudato si’, and his latest message seems certain to rankle conservatives.
Francis described man’s destruction of the environment as a sin and accused mankind of turning the planet into a “polluted wasteland
full of debris, desolation and filth”. “Global warming continues,” the pope said. “2015 was the warmest year on record, and 2016 will
likely be warmer still. This is leading to ever more severe droughts, floods, fires and extreme weather events.
“Climate change is also contributing to the heart-rending refugee crisis. The world’s poor, though least responsible for climate
change, are most vulnerable and already suffering its impact. ” The pope said the faithful should use the Holy Year of Mercy
throughout 2016 to ask forgiveness for sins committed against the environment and our “selfish” system motivated by “profit at
any price”. He called for care for the environment to be added to the seven spiritual works of mercy outlined in the Gospel
that the faithful are asked to perform throughout the pope’s year of mercy in 2016. “We must not be indifferent or resigned to
the loss of biodiversity and the destruction of ecosystems, often caused by our irresponsible and selfish behaviour,” he said.
“Because of us, thousands of species will no longer give glory to God by their very existence … We have no such right.”',

  ('Trump meeting is public disaster for Mexico', 'Mexican president seen as doing little to challenge US Republican candidate
‘The humiliation is now complete,’ tweets TV news anchor', 'President Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico’s decision to meet with possibly
his country’s most-disliked man is turning into a public relations disaster for him, with social media posters and politicians
calling it a national humiliation likely to lower the president’s already historically low popularity ratings.
Not only did Pena Nieto not demand that Donald Trump apologize for calling Mexican migrants rapists and criminals, but he stood
silently by in their joint press conference while the Republican candidate repeated his promise to build a border wall between
the countries.
“This is an insult and a betrayal,” said artist Arturo Meade as he joined a protest against Wednesday’s meeting in Mexico City.
“What can this meeting bring us except surrealism in all its splendor?” Televisa news anchor Carlos Loret de Mola marveled that
 Trump would dare come to Mexico and reiterate his intention to build the wall. “The humiliation is now complete,” he tweeted.
Particularly irksome to Mexicans was that Pena Nieto appeared to do little to push back against Trump’s earlier negative
statements about Mexican migrants and unpopular proposals. Pena Nieto “did not even take a really strong stand and talk to
Mr Trump directly to his face and tell him exactly why his stances are not acceptable to Mexicans,” said Tony Payan, director
 of the Mexico Center at Rice University’s Baker Institute. “He sounded tepid and too soft. He essentially rolled over and
 allowed Mr Trump to get away with his own goals without getting anything in return.”
Pena Nieto did say that Mexicans felt “aggrieved” and had disagreements with Trump, but most felt that it was not enough.
Javier Urbano Reyes, a professor in the department of International Studies at the Iberoamerican University in Mexico City,
said he thought Trump gained a little with the meeting but Mexico’s president lost a lot.
“Without a doubt, my perception is that it is going to make it even worse, even stronger the drop in approval,” he said,
referring to Pena Nieto’s near 20% approval rating, according to recent polls.
Former Mexican president Vicente Fox said Trump was trying to boost his sagging campaign. “He fooled him [Pena Nieto].”
Pena Nieto and Trump even appeared to disagree about what was said in the meeting.
Standing next to Pena Nieto, Trump said the topic of who would pay for the wall would be discussed later. Pena Nieto, at the
 time, said nothing about the wall.
Hours later, Pena Nieto said in a tweet that he had told Trump clearly in their private meeting that Mexico would not pay.
It seemed to contradict Trump’s statement that payment wasn’t discussed, but the president’s office said only that Pena Nieto
 made his statement and the topic was dropped.', TO_TIMESTAMP('2016-09-01 13:16:00', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'));

  ('Ozzy Osbourne genome sequenced', 'Genetic analysis of Black Sabbath star reveals he is more likely to experience hallucinations
   on marijuana and has increased risk of alcohol and cocaine addiction, researchers say',
   'In the continuing quest to understand Ozzy Osbourne, scientists have finally unravelled the singer''s most microscopic mystery:
    his genes. Following in the footsteps of mice and mammoths, Osbourne had his full genome sequenced and analysed by American
    researchers, who uncovered mutations related to addiction, metabolism, and Osbourne''s Neanderthal ancestors.
"I''ve always said that at the end of the world there will be roaches, Ozzy and Keith Richards," said Sharon, Osbourne''s wife,
at a press conference announcing the findings. "He''s going to outlive us all. That fascinated me." Reps for a genetics firm
called Knome approached the Black Sabbath frontman in 2007, asking if he''d consider joining Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates
 and DNA co-discoverer James Watson as one of the few human beings to have had their individual genomes sequenced. Osbourne
 finally consented, giving scientists a blood sample. "I was curious," he explained to the Sunday Times. "Given the swimming
  pools of booze I''ve guzzled over the years – not to mention all of the cocaine, morphine, sleeping pills, cough syrup,
   LSD, Rohypnol … you name it – there''s really no plausible medical reason why I should still be alive. Maybe my DNA could
    say why."
For the moment, the Osbourne genome offers as many questions as answers. "Ozzy carries several hundred thousand variants that
 have never been seen by scientists," Nathaniel Pearson, Knome''s director of research, told Scientific American. "It''s
 going to be a while before we get enough data as a society to understand those variants."
"Many of the variants in his genome are about how the brain processes dopamine," he continued. Osbourne is 2.6 times more
likely to experience hallucinations while on marijuana, has an increased risk of cocaine addiction and "an increased
predisposition for alcohol dependence of something like six times higher", Pearson said. Osbourne''s genes also suggest that
 he is slow to metabolise coffee. "Ozzy''s kryptonite is caffeine," a Knome rep explained. A functioning change to the singer
 ''s TTN gene, which has been linked to the nervous system, may be connected to Osbourne''s hearing or to his tremors.
"Here''s a guy who''s rocking heavy metal for decades and he can still hear," said Jorge Conde, Knome''s chief executive.
"It would be interesting to know if this gene may impact that. [Or] his Parkinsonian tremor – it''s hard to know if that is
 from his genes or from years of hard living."
Furthermore, Osbourne''s got a genetic sliver that once belonged to homo sapiens'' extinct cousins, the Neanderthals. "For
a long time we thought that Neanderthals didn''t have any descendents today, but it turns out that Asians and Europeans have
 some evidence of Neanderthal lineage – like a drop in the bucket," Pearson said. "We found a little segment on Ozzy''s
 chromosome 10 that very likely traces back to a Neanderthal forebear."
"We also looked at [Knome] founder George Church and he has about three times as much [Neanderthal] as Ozzy does," Pearson
 added. To this, Sharon Osbourne''s response was swift: "I''d like to meet him."
Ozzy Osbourne turns 62 next month.', TO_TIMESTAMP('2016-08-5 11:30:00', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'));

        undimmed by the fact that she raps with a distinct Brummie twang: “I didn’t think they’d be able to understand me, didn’t

         hilarious, hearing people with American accents saying ‘bredrin’ and ‘wasteman’, all that British urban slang.”
   But mostly, she’s been working on her debut album. “Working with a producer called Deputy, who made Rihanna’s Bitch Better
   Have My Money; Bangladesh, he made Lil’ Wayne’s A Milli, and Diva and Video Phone for Beyonce. I’ve got a session with Scott
    Storch, he’s coming back now as well. And you know Timbaland?”

   Here, should you want it, is empirical evidence of UK rap’s sudden ascent to prominence in the US, a country traditionally

     become very famous indeed. In fact, she’s already famous – over the course of our interview outside of a north London wine

       freestyles called The Queen’s Speech, which she released herself on iTunes and uploaded to YouTube, accompanied by
       low-budget videos, becoming a viral sensation. Last August’s Queen’s Speech 4 racked up a fairly staggering 31m views.',

  ('The Beautiful Struggle by Ta-Nehisi Coates review', 'Coates, whose Between the World and Me has shot him to literary fame,
  earlier wrote this powerful memoir of his father and coming of age in Baltimore',
   'You’ve never met Ta-Nehisi Coates’s father, but perhaps you know him generically. Paul Coates was that guy, the ageing black
    nationalist with his folding table full of dog-eared books. On sidewalks, at street fairs, at conferences, he coaxed
     wanderers over to inspect his wares – books like Black Egypt and Her Negro Pharaohs, Wonderful Ethiopians of the Ancient
      Cushite Empire, and, of course, the works of Marcus Garvey.
Seven years before the junior Coates published the wildly successful Between the World and Me, he wrote this memoir, brought
 out in January in the UK for the first time. He was, he tells us here, weaned on banal teenage fare – X-Factor comics and
  Narnia – and on books “brought back from the dead”, whose titles promised black people “militant action” and “a return to
  glory”. Coates’s father hustled out-of-print books by black thinkers shunned by the professorial establishment, not only
  on the streets but through a business run out of his basement, Black Classic Press.
Fatherhood and the word figure magically in this pithy, lyrical narrative. Paul Coates was “an intellectual, born as it
 happened among people who could not see a college campus as an outcome”. A Vietnam vet, he favoured tofu and Truffaut films.
 Black history was a forte of his; interpersonal skills were not. In one horrifying and yet comical scene, he visits his wife
 in the hospital when she gives birth. As she rests in her postpartum shine, he has no congratulations or tender words at the
  ready. Instead, he blurts, “Linda, I have another child on the way.”
Paul Coates had seven kids by four women. “He was called to fatherhood like a tainted preacher,” his son confides. “The root was
 his own alcoholic father, who seeded so many children that Dad simply lost count. He impregnated three sisters, and so Dad had
  aunts doubling as stepmothers.” Ta-Nehisi understood his father’s faults, but still regarded him as a prophet.
Ta-Nehisi Coates grew up in 1980s West Baltimore, almost a ghetto before it lay ravaged by Reaganomics, crack, and violence.
A tender, ethereal, bookish child, he tried to keep up with his tough peers, groping for manhood in the dark. “My cheeks were
 fat,” he reveals. “I talked a lot, laughed in such a way that I gave the hardest kids around me permission to laugh. That same
  easiness made me soft, as I bounced awkwardly on my way to class in the morning.”
Coates writes so organically for black Americans, while artfully deflecting what Toni Morrison called ''the white gaze''
Throughout the memoir, his self-deprecation is charming and disarming. He writes about all the nothings he felt the planet pivoted
 on – girl crushes, driver’s licence tests, in-style kicks. Yet a momentous prescience overhangs. “On our life map,” he says, his
  father drew “a bright circle around 12 through 18. This was the abyss where, unguided, black boys were swallowed whole, only to
   re-emerge on corners and prison tiers. Dad was at war with this destiny.” In addressing such issues, this meandering yet
    powerful book throws down stakes both small and very large.', TO_TIMESTAMP('2016-09-01 16:00:00', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'));
